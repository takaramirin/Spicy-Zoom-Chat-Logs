17:29:46	 From  Joshua Leong : Inline class...?
17:29:52	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : explicitly pointing within inline
17:29:52	 From  Ng Alfred : if you want it grey just remove the class
17:29:53	 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN . : CLASS OVERIDES
17:30:04	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : 1. inline
17:30:08	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : 2. internal
17:30:09	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : 3. ext
17:30:09	 From  Kamarullah Salim : class action
17:30:11	 From  KEE ZHONG YI . : inline class
17:30:12	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : correct?
17:30:26	 From  GOU HANG . : oh no ..
17:30:45	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : 1. inline (even if pointing to external css)2. internal3. extI think
17:30:54	 From  Ng Alfred : ^
17:30:56	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : yup
17:30:58	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : ya
17:31:01	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : thanks guys :D
17:31:25	 From  Joshua Leong : so... class > internal?
17:31:32	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : yes
17:31:39	 From  YIP HOU LIANG . : class == inline
17:31:51	 From  Nicholas Ooi : Its like hard coding, u put class to hardcode the color inside
17:32:00	 From  WONG YONG HAN . : what if you got class and inline
17:32:02	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : or u can just put !important ;)
17:32:02	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : wat if u put class and u hardcode the color
17:32:11	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : can there be.... inline with fontcolour set and also pointing class to external css with diff fontcolour?
17:32:13	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : so inline = class?
17:32:16	 From  Nicholas Ooi : class takes precedence over the other inline style and then external just blankets everything
17:32:32	 From  YIP HOU LIANG . : if inline and class together I think inline take precedence
17:32:38	 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN . : inline
17:33:04	 From  Kamarullah Salim : frozen?
17:33:14	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : so does class overwrites inline/internal/ext?
17:33:44	 From  Alfred Pang : style>class?
17:33:52	 From  Ng Alfred : additional properity in the class
17:33:54	 From  Fumin : Inline > Class
17:34:03	 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS . : inline Is king
17:34:05	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : ok noted
17:34:12	 From  Nicholas Ooi : oh if u mean it that way then style Is the king
17:34:13	 From  WONG YONG HAN . : thank you
17:34:24	 From  Nicholas Ooi : but who the hell puts class and style together
17:34:35	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : .
17:34:37	 From  YIP HOU LIANG . : I heard it is a bad practice to do in-line styling, not sure. Can the professor or some one confirm?
17:34:52	 From  JASMIN YAP YI . : ^heard that too
17:35:13	 From  Erin Chee : best not to
17:35:16	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : it can be good practice tho, its fast
17:35:19	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : :x
17:35:25	 From  Kamarullah Salim : IS
17:35:47	 From  Nicholas Ooi : I mean technically speaking using external makes everything looks much neater in terms of your coding
17:36:13	 From  Ze Quan Ong : Separation of concerns
17:40:08	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : wouldn't it be easier to slap an important to it instead?
17:40:28	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : oh no, box and spaces
17:40:39	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : hey its better than inverted A's
17:40:47	 From  Kamarullah Salim : ^
17:41:07	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : inverted  A is?
17:41:12	 From  Jared Song : 1005
17:41:13	 From  Kamarullah Salim : All of
17:41:18	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : oh ok
17:44:29	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : wouldn't it be easier to slap an important to it instead of doing inline style?
17:44:30	 From  GOU HANG . : not sure margin is for what ..
17:44:33	 From  TING WEE ZHEN, GAIUS . : Why don't we use asp.net instead?
17:45:32	 From  GOU HANG . : thanks
17:45:51	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : if we don't have border set, whether margin or  padding we using, doesn't matter?
17:47:12	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : wouldn't it be easier to slap an important to it instead?
17:47:12	 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN . : No
17:48:15	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : amen
17:48:46	 From  Ryan Chew : React
17:49:21	 From  GOU HANG . : bootstrap is a model already built?
17:49:27	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : yeah
17:49:34	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : its just a collection of css people alr wrote
17:49:38	 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS . : Where are the frameworks hosted?
17:49:39	 From  Kamarullah Salim : copy paste
17:49:46	 From  GOU HANG . : haha
17:49:52	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : not even copy paste, we import the whole thing
17:49:57	 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN . : think of it as royalty free music
17:49:59	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : or refer to it
17:50:00	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : on the bootstrap website
17:50:01	 From  Kamarullah Salim : steal 100
17:50:25	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : bootstrap framework can be downloaded locally but wont be up-to-date
17:50:29	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : you're not stealing you're borrowing ;)
17:50:33	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : and its also hosted on their site @Nicholas
17:50:40	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
17:50:47	 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS . : thanks @yuansheng @wenjie
17:51:15	 From  Jeremy Chow : does anyone remember the different frameworks he mentioned?
17:51:29	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : jquery, angular, ... 
17:51:36	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : asp.net is a giant framework of C#
17:51:38	 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN . : you can google them
17:51:47	 From  Jeremy Chow : thanks
17:51:54	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : https://classpert.com/blog/top-bootstrap-alternatives 
17:54:53	 From  Ryan Chew : Does bootstrap have code to change the website to dark mode as well?
17:55:17	 From  YIP HOU LIANG . : yes have different styles
17:55:20	 From  Nicholas Ooi : https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/
17:55:42	 From  Ryan Chew : Nice thanks
17:56:34	 From  ADAM LOH ITT HARP . : downloading can code without wi-fi
17:56:37	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : CDN can be poisoned
17:56:38	 From  WONG YONG HAN . : CDN no need download, but need internet connection
17:56:39	 From  yanhaoo : Security purposes
17:56:40	 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN . : Local is safwer
17:56:40	 From  Jun Hui Foong : Reduced bandwidth when using cdn
17:56:42	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : connecting via cdn wont allow us to work on offline
17:56:47	 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem : lab 2 says if download local, can do offline
17:56:48	 From  LEE XIAN FU . : cdn can lead to security issues
17:56:49	 From  KHO WEN JIE . : but locally wont be updated
17:56:51	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : more convenient?
17:56:51	 From  Nicholas Ooi : It depends on the usage, CDN requires internet connection whereas local is more secure and offline also
17:56:55	 From  CARLTON ANTHONI FOO . : local faster
17:57:01	 From  JESSICA TAN GUANG HUI . : debuging
17:57:05	 From  Jared Song : CDN is always up to date
17:57:13	 From  Ryan Chew : CDN hosting the boostrap can be compromised
17:57:19	 From  HAN EN DING . : can use both?
17:57:20	 From  Nicholas Ooi : CDN is up to date but is more prone to attacks
17:57:20	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : so no need to manually download newer files?
17:57:27	 From  GOU HANG . : for local other computer may not able to use right if they don't download bootstrap?
17:57:28	 From  Jared Song : No need
17:57:33	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : nice
17:57:50	 From  Jared Song : @gou hang yes
17:57:50	 From  TING WEE ZHEN, GAIUS . : lower security with the online version?
17:58:04	 From  CARLTON ANTHONI FOO . : CDN can handle more users
17:58:05	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : understood
17:58:25	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : good to read up a bit i guess?
17:58:27	 From  Jared Song : theoretically online version has lower security but we can use the integrity field to compare the hash
18:02:09	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : hash collision ;)
18:02:19	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : collision?
18:02:24	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : crash?
18:02:28	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : means 2 files can have the same hash
18:02:35	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : which one will be used?
18:02:39	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : if have 2 files the same?
18:02:49	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : which ever is on the cdn
18:02:54	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : ah ok
18:02:59	 From  Jared Song : as in he's saying a hacker could theoretically make a malicious css file that has the same hash
18:03:03	 From  WONG JOON KIAT . : i see
18:03:06	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : the chance of that is astonishingly low, I think
18:03:08	 From  Jared Song : and it would pass the integrity check
18:03:13	 From  Jared Song : but yes @ suhaimi
18:03:16	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : SHA1 is alr dying alr
18:03:18	 From  Ashiq Kareem : no you cannot replicate the same hash what
18:03:22	 From  Ashiq Kareem : if it  is malicious
18:03:27	 From  Ashiq Kareem : it wouldn’t be the same hash
18:03:33	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : yes it can
18:03:33	 From  Ashiq Kareem : because the file would be changed
18:03:37	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : its called hash collision
18:03:39	 From  Jared Song : it's very unlikely but it is possible
18:03:42	 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN . : ^
18:03:44	 From  Ng Zhi Yang : there are attacks on hashing functions themselves yea
18:03:45	 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS . : style sheet maybe unlikely to be targeted imo
18:03:49	 From  Ashiq Kareem : oh wow nice
18:03:52	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : SHA1 is dying
18:04:56	 From  Amos : sha1 dying?
18:05:04	 From  TING WEE ZHEN, GAIUS . : is the link reference an api?
18:05:06	 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem : SHA is?
18:05:09	 From  Ng Zhi Yang : who's sha1
18:05:10	 From  LOW WEI YANG . : how is sha1 dying?
18:05:19	 From  Edwin Nyeow : hash algor
18:05:20	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : its quite vulnerable to collision attacks
18:05:26	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : so its getting deprecated soon
18:05:31	 From  Jared Song : Thank you Yuan Shengh 
18:05:47	 From  Yuan Shengh Seah : SHA1 -> secure hash algorithm
18:05:47	 From  LOW WEI YANG . : wow thanks for sharing good knowledge yan shengh
