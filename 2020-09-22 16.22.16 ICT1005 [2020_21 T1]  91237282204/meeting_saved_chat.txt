15:25:52	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : from CAEM i assume
15:26:16	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : bro logic is the easy topic, induction is hardest around
15:26:23	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : in comparison
15:26:29	 From  LEONG KAH EN . : prof, you are not recording
15:26:32	 From  LOW WEI YANG . : oh what is induction about

15:37:48	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : u get to hell faster
15:37:56	 From  nicholas chong : u have to prove that the base step holds for every subsequent inductive step
15:38:02	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : we are already in hell
15:38:19	 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN . : how do we even show that this is greater tho

15:38:30	 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN . : ???
15:40:12	 From  nicholas chong : I think u have to sub the base step into the induction formula; hopefully she will show ltr
15:40:31	 From  LEE KAI XUAN . : direct proof would require you to prove for every number greater than or equal to 5, which is just impossible
15:40:44	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : ^
15:40:45	 From  LOW WEI YANG . : thats why u use n+1
15:40:47	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : proof by case
15:41:43	 From  LEE KAI XUAN . : basically induction is:1) Prove P(k) is true for some value of k (in this case, 5).2) Assuming P(k) is true, prove P(k+1) is true.3) Now you have proven that P(k) is true for all k >= 5
15:43:31	 From  ASHIQ KAREEM : so is this using universal generalization?
15:43:41	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : no
15:44:10	 From  ASHIQ KAREEM : ah okay i got it
15:44:14	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : this is just proving the equation 
15:45:11	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : to show if its true if n then show that its true for n+1
15:45:31	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : *for n
15:45:34	 From  ASHIQ KAREEM : thank you
15:46:56	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : that dude
