13:00:47	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : keylogger monkaS
13:01:01	 From  Andrew : Wait keystrokes? Is that legal?
13:01:04	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : ya this respondus really try to track everything
13:01:27	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : is it possible to have LaTex in the text box for the future tests to input the symbols? :(
13:01:39	 From  Andrew : So if I type my password it logs my passwords? Why weren't we told about that?
13:01:54	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : cause its laggy when switching tabs
13:02:00	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : why would u need to type ur password after u on lockdown browser thou 
13:02:01	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : after respondus starts you want log in where
13:02:25	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : Where did it ask you to login?
13:02:35	 From  Andrew : Why does it matter what I did? We weren't even told it logs keystrokes!
13:02:57	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : It logs your answers to the quiz, and keystrokes happen to be a part of that
13:03:10	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : If you decide to write your answer to question 1 as your password, its your fault
13:03:11	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : prof just said it logs the keystrokes tho
13:03:29	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : :(
13:03:41	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : and it's kind of implied it logs the keystrokes to monitor us 
13:03:45	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : only selected 3 
13:03:49	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : I think it's part of the agreement you agree 
13:04:02	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : agree to* at the start
13:04:29	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : hey its not respondus' fault u decided to not read the TOS
13:04:44	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : With a browser as sticky as Respondus, it's to be expected how in-depth its logging and telemetry is
13:05:01	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : My worry would be stolen Biometric data from our iris movements and facial recognition systems
13:05:09	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : Not what I typed
13:05:20	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : If any worry beyond the TOS
13:05:23	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : what happened lol
13:07:23	 From  Andrew : Surely someone with OSCP would also understand the implications of a keylogger irregardless? Maybe OSCP isn't as great as I thought it was.
13:07:50	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : Wow
13:07:55	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : if you aren't doing anything significant why are u even worried about getting logged
13:07:58	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : Really Andrew
13:08:01	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : unless you were trying to cheat
13:08:16	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : 90% sure its on respondus' TOS when u installed it
13:08:30	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : "nothing to worry about" is a bad argument tbh
13:08:32	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : no one reads the TOS
13:08:34	 From  Andrew : Really? That "If you aren't doing anything bad, why be afraid of your privacy?"
13:08:38	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : exactly
13:08:42	 From  Andrew : Seriously? That kind of reasoning?
13:08:44	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : The problem isn't whether we were or weren't aware of it's keylogging activities while it is running
13:08:45	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : that's why no one is complaining but him
13:08:48	 From  JONATHAN TAN YU SHEN . : y worry about personal data loss , I mean even mindef database got hacked before
13:08:52	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : But what can it even grab from key logging?
13:09:03	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : what was the TOS violation lol
13:09:08	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : it's not great, but what you gonna do eh

13:10:43	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : ^3
13:10:56	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : don't get ahead of yourselves guys
13:11:05	 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE . : Your choice of threat actors is what's abysmal

13:11:54	 From  LOW WEI YANG . : :D
13:12:04	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : why do you think I have a dedicated SIT machine that is isolated from all my personal accounts lol
13:12:13	 From  Andrew : I mean, I also have a dedicated SIT machine
13:12:28	 From  Andrew : Not sure what you mean by "threat actors", why you using big words when we aren't talking about big stuff?
13:12:38	 From  Andrew : You will be the reason why we would turn into a surveillance state.
13:12:39	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : shut up this is math class
13:12:42	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : chill dude
13:12:50	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : so is any of this related to wotever prof is going through right now?

15:42:02	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : why got circle haha
15:42:10	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : what square?
15:42:12	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : what circle
15:42:13	 From  Nicholas Ooi : I think circle means with itself
15:42:14	 From  JAS PANG ZE XIN . : (3,3)
15:42:20	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : oo
15:42:38	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : a way for drawing a relation, each arrow represents a tuple
15:43:47	 From  KOH HUAN YIN . : just a subset 
15:44:05	 From  Alfred Pang : never put full
15:44:13	 From  Nicholas Ooi : so (1, b) is also another relation?
15:44:17	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : subset
15:44:20	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : not proper subset
15:44:30	 From  CHONG FU MIN . : cartesian product means tuple elements?
15:44:35	 From  Nicholas Ooi : (1, b) is another subset?
15:44:38	 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN . : the set itself is the subset of itself
15:44:47	 From  CHAM ZHENG HAN, DONOVAN . : hey guyswho did tutorial already
15:44:57	 From  CHAM ZHENG HAN, DONOVAN . : question 7 in the tutorial is to prove?
15:45:01	 From  SUHAIMI BIN ROSLAN . : you must indicate {(1,b)}
15:45:49	 From  Alfred Pang : so a subset = relation right?
15:45:49	 From  LIM JIN TAO BENJAMIN . : so anything in P(A X B)? 
15:45:56	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : yeah
15:45:58	 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH . : basically
15:46:00	 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM . : subset of cartesian product
15:46:04	 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM . : = relation
15:46:21	 From  Alfred Pang : alright
15:46:55	 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS . : so if we evaluate the cardinality of the subset of cartesian product {(0,a),(0,a)} we still count as 2?
15:48:30	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : {(0,a)} and {(0,a),(0,a)} are equivalent
15:48:35	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : because sets
15:49:23	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : a divides b -- b is divided by a
15:49:24	 From  Leow Yong Zheng : english
15:49:32	 From  CHAN SI EN IVAN . : modulus I think
15:49:37	 From  CHAM ZHENG HAN, DONOVAN . : a divides b = b is divided by a
15:49:38	 From  CHAN SI EN IVAN . : b/a mod 0
15:49:40	 From  CHAM ZHENG HAN, DONOVAN . : b/a
15:52:32	 From  MUHAMMAD NAZRI BIN SAPIAH . : brother sister
15:53:28	 From  Nicholas Ooi : r6?
