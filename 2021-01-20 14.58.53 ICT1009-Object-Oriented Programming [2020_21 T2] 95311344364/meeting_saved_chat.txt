11:53:06 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : hello guys!
12:00:59 From  LIM CHENG LIANG .  to  Everyone : hi prof, isit ok to clarify what you mean by multiplayer game during this lesson
12:01:07 From  LIM CHENG LIANG .  to  Everyone : such as what type of games are allowed etc
12:01:34 From  Nisha Jain  to  Everyone : Hi yes I will be clarifying and discussing about it 
12:01:53 From  ONG ZE QUAN .  to  Everyone : Prof, I was added to wrong team in Github
12:02:17 From  Hang Gou  to  Everyone : prof I haven't join the slack the qr code expire
12:03:53 From  Donovan Cham  to  Everyone : prof I don't have the GitHub invitation link for the team repo. Have already added my id into the google sheets since last Friday or so
12:04:03 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : Same
12:09:51 From  NG ZHENG HAN .  to  Everyone : so something like e.g Chess 1 player a turn is that allowed?
12:10:32 From  NG ZHENG HAN .  to  Everyone : ahh okay understood prof
12:10:39 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : so turn based multiplayer not allowed?
12:10:44 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE  to  Everyone : Ok, no networking needed. That's a relief
12:11:12 From  KOH HUAN YIN .  to  Everyone : basically concurrent playing
12:11:17 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : so no turn based
12:11:19 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : ?
12:11:30 From  Jia Cheng Koh  to  Everyone : turned based multiplayer is still multiplayer tho
12:11:32 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : :c pokemon online matchmaking isn't multiplayer ;w;
12:11:34 From  KOH HUAN YIN .  to  Everyone : like chess and tic tac toe?
12:13:25 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : abolish this project, will be smooth sail and no delays
12:13:32 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH .  to  Everyone : ^
12:13:37 From  Jas Pang  to  Everyone : ^
12:13:39 From  KAMARULLAH BIN MOHAMAD SALIM .  to  Everyone : ^
12:13:39 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN .  to  Everyone : pogchamp
12:13:41 From  Koh Jia Cheng  to  Everyone : ^
12:13:42 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ^
12:13:45 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH .  to  Everyone : BibleThump
12:13:48 From  KOH HUAN YIN .  to  Everyone : lol
12:13:56 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : hahaha
12:14:02 From  SEAH YUAN SHENGH .  to  Everyone : F
12:14:07 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : xD
12:14:19 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : sorry I don't know what does abolish means
12:14:22 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : apologies, prof
12:15:34 From  ONG ZE QUAN .  to  Everyone : what about wrong team in GitHub
12:16:01 From  TAN CHIN HOW .  to  Everyone : later got lab?
12:24:52 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : yes
12:31:13 From  KEE ZHONG YI .  to  Everyone : Just to clarify, without new if you change one of the strings will both change?
12:32:33 From  KEE ZHONG YI .  to  Everyone : Ahh, I see. Thanks prof!
12:35:34 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : so with new, ur creating an object... without new, ur just initializing a variable... variable uses == to compare while object has to use .equal, if ur using == ur only comparing object address
12:36:51 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : :o
12:37:32 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : the current example is to just compare the objects?
12:37:47 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : using .equals to compare 2 objects?
12:37:57 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : objects' content
12:38:05 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok thanks wen jie!
12:38:21 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN .  to  Everyone : so in an ifelse its just if (result == true)?
12:38:36 From  LEONG JIN KUAN, JOSHUA .  to  Everyone : if there are multiple variables in the content how do we specify the comparison?
12:38:38 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : if got use new keyword, will be comparing the objects, instead of just contents?
12:39:05 From  LEONG JIN KUAN, JOSHUA .  to  Everyone : oh ok
12:40:30 From  NCHOLAS CHONG  to  Everyone : nope
12:40:32 From  NCHOLAS CHONG  to  Everyone : all is good
12:44:19 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : so .remove will remove the "Puerto Rico" from the array list?
12:44:20 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : So it makes multiple arrays?
12:44:30 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : thanks prof!
12:45:46 From  NCHOLAS CHONG  to  Everyone : arraylist is a dynamic array structure where u can dynamically add and remove objects/non primitive data type
12:46:26 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : Each object inside is basically an element in the array?
12:47:38 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : I see thanks prof
12:53:15 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : the input is based on the last entry?
12:54:32 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok thanks prof!
12:58:56 From  TAN YI SHENG .  to  Everyone : prof the minu sign in the uml means private right
12:59:02 From  TAN YI SHENG .  to  Everyone : minus*
12:59:52 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : private = accessible within class
13:00:12 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : public = accessible outside class? Is it correct?
13:00:30 From  KOH HUAN YIN .  to  Everyone : do we automatically assume those class and operations return a void type for the UML without signature?
13:01:36 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM  to  Everyone : @joon kiat yes
13:01:43 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok thanks Irfan!
13:02:24 From  KOH HUAN YIN .  to  Everyone : ah thank you prof
13:02:27 From  NCHOLAS CHONG  to  Everyone : @irfan *thumbs up*
13:02:37 From  Alicia Tan  to  Everyone : @irfan thanks!
13:03:14 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok prof, noted
13:16:03 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : so protected and public is the same?
13:16:24 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM  to  Everyone : protected = within packages
13:16:38 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM  to  Everyone : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html
13:16:41 From  AIDIL IRFAN BIN AZAM  to  Everyone : more info here
13:16:49 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : oo thanks :)
13:21:20 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : a bit blur on static/contant values, prof nisha
13:21:28 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok
13:24:33 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok thanks prof!
13:24:35 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : yes
13:25:31 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : static on function means that you call that function by referencing a class, not by referencing an instance
13:28:33 From  Suhaimi -  to  Everyone : the less I know the better
13:43:53 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : for Weight and Height, having public or not doesn't matter?
13:44:24 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : ohh by default public
13:46:56 From  PHUA DE XUAN, PERCY .  to  Everyone : no modifier is not the same as public
13:49:11 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : because its static right? That's why the value is changed from 1 to 10?
13:49:25 From  Hang Gou  to  Everyone : private = only can be moderate called by function inside the class
13:49:29 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN  to  Everyone : make a public function
13:49:29 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : is private
13:49:33 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : oh ok, my apologies
13:49:47 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : thanks guys!
13:49:51 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : and prof*
13:51:13 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : displayhr
14:01:03 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : Constructors will be automatically recognized if u put the same name as the class?
14:01:47 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : ok thanks prof
14:06:22 From  ONG ZE QUAN .  to  Everyone : Basically constructors allow overloading
14:07:13 From  Hang Gou  to  Everyone : the latest constructor will be the final value ?
14:07:28 From  Hang Gou  to  Everyone : for overloading
14:08:12 From  TAN JUN KAI, CALVIN .  to  Everyone : both constructors are valid, and will execute depending on what parameters you pass in when you create a new object instance
14:08:18 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : what if I put 2 parametrized constructors?
14:08:25 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : the constructors do not take effect until you call them. You can use any defined constructor, Java will automatically select the one that matches the parameters used
14:14:34 From  TAN JUN KAI, CALVIN .  to  Everyone : prof, would the square constructor work seeing as it has the same number of params as the constructor for the circle?
14:14:44 From  TAN JUN KAI, CALVIN .  to  Everyone : ah
14:14:49 From  TAN JUN KAI, CALVIN .  to  Everyone : okay
14:16:01 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : isn't int implicitly castable into double?
14:16:10 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : nvm
14:28:33 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : clear prof
14:28:34 From  NIKOS WEE YI ZHONG .  to  Everyone : if we use the this for inclass and tobj for outclass will the output be the same pro?
14:28:45 From  NIKOS WEE YI ZHONG .  to  Everyone : prf*
14:29:28 From  NIKOS WEE YI ZHONG .  to  Everyone : oh ok thank you
14:30:40 From  Ng Swee Kiat  to  Everyone : room number missing a 1
14:30:44 From  Leong Shao Zhi  to  Everyone : roomnumber
14:30:46 From  Leong Shao Zhi  to  Everyone : missing a 1
14:30:46 From  Ren Jiaqi  to  Everyone : did you mean '2021ICT1009' instead of '2021ICT009'?
14:30:47 From  Suhaimi -  to  Everyone : 1009
14:30:48 From  LIM ZHAO XIANG .  to  Everyone : The room number on the slide is missing an 1 after the ICT
14:30:52 From  ALOYSIUS CHONG JUN FENG .  to  Everyone : the room number is wrong
14:30:54 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : you wrote 009 instead of 1009
14:31:25 From  Nisha Jain  to  Everyone : 2021ICT1009
14:32:56 From  NG ZHENG HAN .  to  Everyone : This quiz is not graded right? just to test our understanding right?
14:33:08 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : We answer one qn at at time?
14:33:09 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : later got leaderboard top 10 get 1%
14:33:11 From  ADAM LOH ITT HARP .  to  Everyone : siaoliao
14:33:11 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : thank goodness.. quite stressful...
14:33:13 From  NG ZHENG HAN .  to  Everyone : ok thanks prof haha
14:33:15 From  HUN YEW KWANG, BRIAN .  to  Everyone : ptsd
14:33:19 From  Koh Jia Cheng  to  Everyone : ah shit, here we go again
14:33:32 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN  to  Everyone : will the class tests be this 'hard'
14:33:35 From  DYLAN MICHAEL OGLE .  to  Everyone : worth "bonus" percentage
14:34:23 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS  to  Everyone : @reuben i hoe the class tests will be this 'hard'
14:34:27 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS  to  Everyone : hope
14:34:31 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : if only theres marks for trying haha

14:36:57 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok
14:37:46 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : example of parameters in constructors?
14:38:15 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN  to  Everyone : void (x,y) function static final{}
14:38:34 From  CHONG WEI BING NICHOLAS  to  Everyone : ^
14:38:42 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok noted!

14:39:15 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN  to  Everyone : oh
14:39:16 From  CHONG WEI WEN REUBEN  to  Everyone : ok thanks prof!
14:40:17 From  TAN YI SHENG .  to  Everyone : prof next time do such quiz on kahoot then can see the options when submitted
14:40:36 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : is it 1,1,1?
14:41:32 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : I chose a diff answer
14:41:53 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : ooh

14:42:13 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : we shall find out soon
14:42:22 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : oh nice..
14:42:22 From  Hang Gou  to  Everyone : different object right?
14:42:35 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : yes becuz its diff object
14:42:47 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : what about diff objects?
14:42:49 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : i think? XD
14:42:49 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : does count++ and ++count matter?
14:43:06 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : in this case, no, because we aren't passing count to anything
14:43:08 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : ++count can run?
14:43:08 From  TAN JUN KAI, CALVIN .  to  Everyone : in this case no
14:43:28 From  ALARIC TANG MING KUN .  to  Everyone : i see thanks guys :)
14:43:41 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : so the var in each object will be incremental?
14:43:54 From  TAN YI SHENG .  to  Everyone : yes ++count exist
14:43:59 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : thx
14:44:07 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : yeah its not static, so every object has its own separate copy of the integer
14:44:20 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : ok
14:44:43 From  LEOW YONG ZHENG .  to  Everyone : plus its not private, so referencing .count outside won't cause a compilation error
14:45:09 From  TAN YI SHENG .  to  Everyone : @raheem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21186950/count-and-count-when-to-use-which/21186994
14:45:20 From  Muhammad Abdurraheem Bin Abdul Hamid  to  Everyone : eh man thx so much
14:45:21 From  WONG JOON KIAT .  to  Everyone : "this" is to represent current/present class? Am I right?

14:56:54 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : so now C1 shares the same object address? or just the content same
14:57:00 From  Suhaimi -  to  Everyone : Is there any way to refer to the old c1 object if we reassigned the c1 pointer
14:57:11 From  KHO WEN JIE .  to  Everyone : :o
